# ThreatDetector

# Project Overview
This project aims to build a comprehensive system for detecting, storing, and analyzing IP addresses associated with various cyber threats. By leveraging API integration and advanced categorization techniques, the system will help organizations respond more effectively to a wide range of cyber attacks.
Motivation
In today's digital landscape, cyber threats come in many forms, including but not limited to:

* Phishing
* Malware
* Man-in-the-middle attacks
* SQL injections
* Cryptojacking
* Password attacks
* Denial of Service (DoS)
* Insider threats
* Social engineering

My system addresses the need for a unified solution that can detect and categorize these diverse threats, providing timely alerts based on their type and severity.

# Features

* IP Address Collection: Gathers and stores IP addresses from network traffic or databases.
* Threat Analysis: Utilizes API integration (VirusTotal or AbuseIPDB) to analyze collected IP addresses.
* Multi-Category Classification: Classifies threats into various categories including malware, phishing, SQL injection, and more.
* Risk Assessment: Categorizes threats by risk level (low, medium, high, severe).
* Alert System: Triggers alerts based on the type and severity of detected threats.

# Project Timeline

* Week 1: Project Planning and API Research
* Week 2: API Integration
* Weeks 3-4: IP Address Generation/Storage System
* Weeks 5-6: Threat Categorization by Type
* Weeks 7-8: Risk-Based Alert System
* Week 9: Testing with Various Threat Types
* Week 10: Optimization and Refinement
